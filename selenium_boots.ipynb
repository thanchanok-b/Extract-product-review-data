      "I read all the bumph surrounding this, and thought I would splash out - this meant a change from my normal skin care regieme. It sounded very promising, with fantastic reviews, so why not fork out nearly 40 quid on something that will make me look more youthfull? I persevered and persevered for 2 weeks - its a horrible sticky serum, that actually gave me little pimples, particularly on my upper lip. I didnt like the feel of it, and my skin did NOT (I repeat DID NOT) either glow, improve or renew as everyone seems to claim it does. Back to Liz for my skin care routine, which always worked well, and which I love. Just 4 days of reverting, and my skin is looking much better - spots have gone. If you fall for the hype, your purse will not thank you.\n",

I have not used the night serum this evening to see if the rash and swelling improves overnight. I have no idea what ingredient in this new night serum, could have caused this reaction.\n",

After three nights without noticing a reaction, I applied it to a larger area. The next morning, my skin was red, burning, bumpy and itchy so, unfortunately, it is yet another product that I will no longer be able to use.\n",

      "What a fantastic night serum. I normally use the lauder night repair , but I have to say the texture and scent of No7's night serum is much nicer, better value for money and better quality ingredients. My skin feels and looks more smoother, more hydrated with less visible lines just after a couple of weeks. I highly recommend this product.\n",

      "This is a lovely serum. It has a light fresh cucumber scent, which is really nice and it is gentle on the skin. I apply this nightly after cleansing and by the next morning, my skin is beautifully soft. It only takes 5 minutes or so to absorb. Will definitely continue use as my skin feels nice and glowy and plumped after this and I definitely think it’s helping with fine lines.\n",

      "The texture of the serum is smoothing, it helps hydrate my skin and absorbs well. I was hoping it would firm my skin a bit but it was very hydrating and made my skin look fresh. It applies easily with a pump bottle top. I didn't notice a strong scent, it's quite mild. I like it but I'm not sure if I'd use it again.\n",

      "I love a serum, so was very excited to try this. I did the whole routine and used the serum every night for a month. I love the lightness of it and it has a fresh smell, not particularly luxurious in that way, but it melts into the skin really quickly with no stickiness. My skin looks nourished and clear in the morning so much so I’ve hardly wore makeup.\n",

      "This product looks luxurious and has a lovely texture to it, enabling good absorption, however, I found even after applying with enough time before bed it still felt a bit sticky and I could feel the product on my pillow. I had really high hopes for this product aiming to target fine lines, uneven tone and texture, dryness and loss of firmness, but even after religiously using it every night under my usual night cream for at least a month, I really can’t see any noticeable difference. It really feels lovely when you first apply it, but overall I’m a bit disappointed - I was expecting a little more from it.\n",

A little goes a very long way and it absorbs into my skin really easily, leaving it feeling really moisturised. It has a very subtle scent- which I have struggled to identify- but it is gentle on sensitive skin. My skin is definitely less dry since I have been using this, so I would most definitely recommend.\n",

I’m not sure I can notice much difference in my skin but it does leave my skin with a nice glow for the next day. I did find that if I applied my moisturiser too soon after applying the serum that it made my skin sting for a little while. I changed moisturisers to see if that would help but it was still the same. This didn’t happen when I left a longer gap between applying the two.\n",

However I was pleasantly surprised as even though it has the texture of a normal serum, it actually moisturises. During winter and spring months I can get dry patches on my face - this serum has totally cleared them up and left my face super smooth and soft. No dryness at all! I am 50 and need a bit of help in the skin smoothing area - and this is just a super addition to my night routine. I always use before bed, it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin lovely and smooth by the morning. No real noticeable fragrance which I prefer. Definitely recommended!\n",

I have used it for several weeks now, it was nice enough and went on well & my skin after a few days did actually feel quite soft in the mornings. But the best thing about it was I found the slight Rosacea I have on my cheeks was suddenly not as bad as usual. I found this a real bonus and therefore I will continue to use it & will probably buy it when the sample is finished. So yes I would recommend it.\n",

      "Okay, this is from a woman with mild rosacea and generally sensitive skin who has to battle between wanting to try out fancy products that promise more even toned and plump skin vs the reality that most such products are irritating. This new serum somehow manages to produce immediately noticeable results as well as a visible improvement over a few weeks. My skin was left looking bouncy and glowing. There are no real downsides, the minor issue is that I found the smell to be unpleasant on application (a kind of metallic cucumber that smelled like chemicals) but that really fades fast.\n",

      "I was hesitant to try this evening moisturizer, especially with my unpredictable, sensitive skin thanks to perimenopause. I’ve had my fair share of bad reactions to new products — dryness, breakouts, and irritation — so an unknown brand felt like a gamble. But I’m so glad I gave it a chance! The texture is rich but not heavy, and it absorbs beautifully without leaving a greasy feel. I woke up with my skin feeling soft, calm, and hydrated — no redness or irritation in sight. After a few nights, I even noticed my skin looked smoother and more balanced. For anyone navigating perimenopausal skin changes and feeling nervous about trying something new, this moisturizer was a pleasant surprise. It delivered gentle, nourishing hydration without aggravating my skin. Definitely a new favorite in my routine!\n",

      "When the bottle arrived I was slightly surprised to find a white, emulsified serum with the look and feel of more of a day serum than my usual night serum's that have been more oil based for over a decade. The serum is fairly odourless and absorbs easily. For my skin this is what has been the noticeable benefits after several weeks of use Improvements Appearance of pores Tighter skin overall Skin glow Appearance of \"turkey skin\" under chin and on neck No change Dark circles under eyes\n",

      "I have used this serum every night for the past 3 weeks and noticed a difference after the first couple of nights. The serum goes on smoothly, the scent is subtle and it seems to soak in very quickly leaving no greasy residue. The next day my face feels smoother and I feel like it’s got a lovely glow. My fine lines also appear reduced. I will definitely be carrying on with this and it has very quickly become my favourite product in my evening routine!\n",
