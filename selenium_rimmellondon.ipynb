I noticed that the powder tend to break easily when I carry it in my hand bag.. but I am happy to compromise given the price tag, performance and don’t change the formula and add lots of other things please..maybe you could do a version with better, secured packaging with a mirror for a a slightly higher price but also have cheaper refills :)\n",

The powder itself is nice but the application sponge that comes with it is AWFUL! it’s plastic on the back which actually scratches your skin so you have to hold it bent to even be able to use. I am unsure why they would ever put that type of material on a makeup sponge. I will definitely have to return to the brand I have used for years.\n",

The only thing is that it oxidizes so it is better to buy a lighter shade. Amazing powder, i feel Safe when i have it with me. The results are amazing not even vakey or smthing\n",
